## Showcases Needing Updates (Priority List)

### High Priority (Popular/Reference)

1. **elide-base** - Core template needs fetch handler verification
2. **fullstack-template** - Template showcase
3. **api-gateway** (basic) - Check for beta10 shim

### Medium Priority (Enterprise)

4. **financial-modeling-platform** - 2,491 lines README, needs trim
5. **cybersecurity-platform** - 2,123 lines README
6. **climate-simulation-platform** - Long README
7. **audio-production-studio** - May have incomplete features

### Low Priority (Older/Specialized)

8. Various legacy bridge showcases - May need minor updates
9. Python-only showcases - Verify WSGI compatibility

---

## Missing elide.pkl (3 items)

Based on count difference (216 dirs - 213 pkl files = 3 missing):

Likely candidates:
- Documentation files (*.md files in showcases dir)
- Potentially incomplete showcases

---

## Dependency Analysis

### Most Common npm Dependencies

1. `sentiment` - NLP showcases
2. `react@18` / `react-dom@18` - Frontend showcases
3. Various ML libraries in Python showcases

### Python Dependencies (via WSGI)

1. Flask - Web framework
2. NumPy - Numerical computing
3. Pandas - Data analysis
4. TensorFlow/PyTorch - ML frameworks

### Java/Kotlin Dependencies

1. Spring Boot - Enterprise Java
2. Ktor - Kotlin web framework
3. kotlinx libraries - Serialization, HTML, coroutines

## Quality Assessment by Wave

| Wave | Showcases | Quality | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Original | ~150 | Good | Core showcases |
| Wave 6 (Kotlin) | 3 | Excellent | 15K+ LOC each |
| Wave 7 (Enterprise) | 8 | Excellent | 8-20K LOC each |
| Polyglot Patterns | 50+ | Good | Pattern demonstrations |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Verify remaining 3 showcases have elide.pkl
2. **Short-term:** Update showcases using beta10 shim to fetch handler
3. **Medium-term:** Trim excessively long READMEs (>2000 lines)
4. **Long-term:** Add integration tests to Kotlin showcases
